		<h2>Interests </h2>
			<p>My interests include biking. Since I am not old enough to drive, I use my bike to get around a go to places. My other interests is playing electronic games or video games. I have been playing since I was around 4 years old and it is a great way to consume time. It is even better now that I can talk to my friends online. My 3rd interest is Basketball. I got a basketball around the age of 7. At the time. We didnâ€™t have a basketball hoop so I used to throw the basketball on the roof on my garage to practice shooting. </p>
