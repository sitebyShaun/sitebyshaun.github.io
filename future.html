		<h1>My future</h1>
		
		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p>The high school I plan to go to is Whitney High School and if not, I will either end up in Cerritos high or Millikan. This will lead me to move districts which will be sort of sad because I have been with my friends since kindergarden. .</p>

		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>My number 1 favorite college is definitely UCLA. Ever since Iâ€™ve heard of it and saw the logo, I was hooked to it. The other two I might prefer is UC Berkeley or Stanford  </p>
			
		<h2>Career Interests </h2>
			<p> I want to be a computer programmer or computer scientist. My father is a computer programmer and he is very successful so I would just like to follow in his footsteps. As said in my interests, I love electronic games and electronics in general, so I feel that working in computers would be the best for me.</p>
			
		<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>My goal in life is to make enough money to support my family and make sure everyone has a great life. I would also like a family because I am the only child and would like to continue on to the next generation. Other than that, traveling world would be nice and being healthy.qw </p>
