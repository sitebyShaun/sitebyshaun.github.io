		<h1>My memories</h1>
		
		<h2>Dogs</h2>
			<p>I've had a lot of dogs throughout my life. Around the age of five, what I last remember were my three golden retrievers. I have forgotten their names but they were still a big part of my life. My most vivid memory of them is when they stole my slipper and I got mad and sprayed them with hose outside. They then snuck inside and started jumping all over the furniture and I was in big trouble. We ended up selling those dogs eventially though. To continue, at my grandmothers work, they had a dog willing to sell which was half shit-zu, half pomeranian. We still have that one today. We then found a stray dog wandering around out neighboor hood and took care of it. As we started finding out that it was hard to manage it, we sold it to an owner and have never seen it since. I love my dogs and I always probably will.   </p>

			
		<h2>Vacations</h2>
			<p>I have been on a handful of vacations when I was younger but since school has been getting more serious, I have been on as much. Anyways, there are some I still definetly remember.One is the camping trip to Utah and the mountains up there. That was the first time I have ever encountered snow. It was amazing but I expected it to be softer. Another trip I remember was the camping trip to Sacremento. There were a lot of creatures such as tarantualas, snakes, and some foxes. It was definetly a life changing experience and I would love to go again. Finally, I went to the Phillipines for 3 weeks. I adored seeing my relatives that I have never met before and experiencing a very unlucky 3rd world country.</p>
