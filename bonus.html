		<h1>My memories</h1>
		
		<h2>Dogs</h2>
			<p>I've had a lot of dogs throughout my life. Around the age of five, what I last remember were my three golden retrievers. I have forgotten their names but they were still a big part of my life. My most vivid memory of them is when they stole my slipper and I got mad and sprayed them with hose outside. They then snuck inside and started jumping all over the furniture and I was in big trouble. We ended up selling those dogs eventially though. To continue, at my grandmothers work, they had a dog willing to sell which was half shit-zu, half pomeranian. We still have that one today. We then found a stray dog wandering around out neighboor hood and took care of it. As we started finding out that it was hard to manage it, we sold it to an owner and have never seen it since. I love my dogs and I always probably will.   </p>

			
		<h2>Vacations</h2>
			<p> I want to be a computer programmer or computer scientist. My father is a computer programmer and he is very successful so I would just like to follow in his footsteps. As said in my interests, I love electronic games and electronics in general, so I feel that working in computers would be the best for me.</p>
